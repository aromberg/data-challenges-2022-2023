    This data challenge is about finding differences in how different genders
    are affected by chronic diseases.
    ### Why is this important?
    - 💢 Studies have found **significant differences** in how men and women are affected by chronic diseases: prevalence, degree of severity and symptoms
    - 👫 Gender differences not only have a **direct impact on the health behaviour, exposures, social factors**, but also on needs and access to care of women and men
    - 🏥 **Governments and health systems** do **not always recognize** or **address** this sufficiently: health systems can also indirectly contributes to gender inequalities in health
